## üìä Dataset

-   **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Heart Disease Dataset (Cleveland)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
-   **Details:** 303 records with 13 clinical features and a target label indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.
-   **Key Features:** age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic results (restecg), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), exercise induced angina (exang), ST depression (oldpeak), slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope), number of major vessels (ca), thalassemia (thal).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run this project locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Heart-Disease-Prediction-tabular-ML-web-app-.git
    cd Heart-Disease-Prediction-tabular-ML-web-app-
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # On macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## üìà Project Workflow

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Loaded and cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and performed feature scaling/normalization.
2.  **Model Training & Evaluation:** Trained and compared multiple algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest). The best performing model was selected, evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score, and serialized for use in the app.
3.  **Web Application Development:**
    -   **Backend (Flask):** Set up routes (`app.py`) to handle the homepage, form processing, prediction logic, and result display.
    -   **Frontend (Jinja2 Templates):** Created HTML templates for forms and results, styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS.
4.  **Testing & Deployment:** Tested the application locally and prepared it for deployment on a cloud platform.

## üöÄ Deployment

This app is configured for easy deployment on **Render** or **Heroku**.

### Deployment to Render (Recommended)
1.  Ensure your `requirements.txt` file is up to date.
2.  Create a `render.yaml` file or connect your GitHub repo directly to Render.
3.  Set the build command to `pip install -r requirements.txt` and the start command to `gunicorn app:app`.

*For detailed deployment guides, please check the official documentation of your chosen platform.*
